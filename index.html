        <h1>Hi, I’m Breanna — but you can call me Bre.</h1>

<p class="pitch">
    I graduated from the University of Arizona (go Wildcats!) with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Computing, with an emphasis in Information Management.
    I’ve always been naturally curious, and I tend to approach problems like puzzles. I like asking questions, figuring things out on my own,
    and really understanding how something works instead of just getting to the answer.
</p>

<p class="pitch">
    I thrive in structured environments that still allow for some independence. I enjoy having clear expectations while also being trusted to
    manage my work and think through problems on my own. I originally started out as a software development major, but I realized I missed the
    visual side of things — the “pretty colors,” as I like to say. Applied Computing gave me a better balance between code, data, and design,
    which felt like a much better fit for how I think and work.
</p>

<p class="pitch">
    Outside of work and school, I love traveling and exploring new cities, and spending time with my family. We’re pretty close-knit,
    and that sense of connection and support is something I really value and try to bring into the way I work with others.
